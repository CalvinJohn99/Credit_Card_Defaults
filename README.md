# About the Project
This repository showcases my personal project where I analysed data regarding customer credit card defaults for Taiwan in 2005 using PowerBI. The data was extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository, however, the data was altered prior to use. A new column, 'STATE' was added to the data that randomly assigned a state location in USA to customer.
